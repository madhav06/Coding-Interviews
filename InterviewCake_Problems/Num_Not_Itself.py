# Given some simple variables:

# big_num_1   = 1000
# big_num_2   = 1000
# small_num_1 = 1
# small_num_2 = 1


# What's the output we get from running the following?

# big_num_1   is big_num_2
# small_num_1 is small_num_2

# list_1 = [1,2,3]

# list_2 = [1,2,3]

# print("list_1 == list_2? %s" %(list_1 == list_2)) # true
# print("list_1 is list_2? %s" %(list_1 is list_2)) # false


big_num_1 = 1000

small_num_1 = 1
small_num_2 = 1

print("big_num_1 is big_num_2? %s" %(big_num_1 is big_num_2)) ## for big numbers it will be false

print("small_num_1 is small_num_2? %s" %s(small_num_1 is small_num_1)) ## for small numbers it is true.
