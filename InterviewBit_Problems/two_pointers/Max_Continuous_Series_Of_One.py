# Max Continuous Series of 1s
# https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/max-continuous-series-of-1s/
#
# You are given with an array of 1s and 0s. And you are given with an integer M, which signifies number of flips allowed.
# Find the position of zeros which when flipped will produce maximum continuous series of 1s.
#
# For this problem, return the indices of maximum continuous series of 1s in order.
#
# Example:
#
# Input :
# Array = {1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 }
# M = 1
#
# Output :
# [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
#
# If there are multiple possible solutions, return the sequence which has the minimum start index.
#
