# Python 3

# Rearrange a given array so that Arr[i] becomes Arr[Arr[i]] with O(1) extra space.

# Example:

# Input : [1, 0]
# Return : [0, 1]
#  Lets say N = size of the array. Then, following holds true :
# All elements in the array are in the range [0, N-1]
# N * N does not overflow for a signed integer



class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # Modify the array A which is passed by reference. 
    # You do not need to return anything in this case. 
    def arrange(self, A):
        n = len(A)
        for i in range(n):
            A[i] += (A[A[i]]%n)*n
        for i in range(n):
            A[i] = A[i]//n
